This repository contains the assets for a static website that enables users to generate and print proxies for Magic: The Gathering, with support for deck formats from Scryfall, Deckstats, Moxfield, and more.
[The website is available here](https://mtg-proxies.pastel-puppet.workers.dev/), or by following the link in the repository information section.

Some of the most useful features include:
 - Printed cards are sized to the correct dimensions, just print at 100% scale, cut out each card, and sleeve.
 - Card printings can be chosen for each card before printing.
 - If the format permits, card printings selected in the deck builder are used.
 - Two deck lists can be provided and only the cards added in the second list are printed, ideal for iterating on a playtest deck.
 - Tokens, emblems, and other associated card types can be added automatically.
 - Check the help menu on the website for more information on how to use it.
